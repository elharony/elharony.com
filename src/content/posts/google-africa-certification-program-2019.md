<h2>BONUS: Increase your chance of getting accepted</h2>
A Scholarship like Google Africa Certification Program is VERY competitive, and hard to complete till the end. Therefore, Here are some tips to help you out:
<h3>Start early - NOW!</h3>
The deadline is 15 May 2019, oh let's register & watch the courses later... DON'T do that, you need to start earlier to know how it works, form a base knowledge, understand the curriculum and the program as a whole, and getting more familiar with Pluralsight Platform.
<h3>The more, The better</h3>
Dedicate more time for this program.  The more content you watch, the higher chance you get to proceed into the next phase, and the highest value you get.
<blockquote>Remember, your goal is to "learn" not "complete" X amount of courses. So, keep reminding yourself to focus on <strong>Quality</strong> over <strong>Quantity</strong>!</blockquote>
<h3>I don't deserve it (Or, I deserve it all)</h3>
There are so many applicants believe they don't deserve it or can't do it. Maybe, they are shifting career or don't have any prior experience. On the contrary, there are applicants who have prior experience, who think they will nail it and definitely get accepted.

In conclusion, don't underestimate or overestimate yourself. Watch the preparation courses, and do what you have to.

Good Luck to all applicants! ♥
