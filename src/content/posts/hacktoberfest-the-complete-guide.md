<h2>FAQs</h2>
As a developer who is participating in Hacktoberfest for the first time, I had a few questions and I decided to share them with you:
<h3>Am I allowed to submit pull requests that don't contain any code (aka. Documentation)?</h3>
Yes, every pull request counts, whether you're implementing a feature, improving an existing User Interface, or enhancing the project documentation.
<h3>Can I submit PRs to my own repos?</h3>
It still counts. But remember, the main reason for Hacktoberfest is to improve others' Open Source Projects!
<h3>Can I submit multiple PRs to the same repo?</h3>
Yes, you can, and it still counts.
<h3>What if my PRs aren't merged?</h3>
You don't need your PRs to get merged to be counted. Every "submitted" PR since 1 October counts, regardless if it was merged or not.
<h3>Can I get more swags?</h3>
Yes, it's not just about the Limited Edition T-Shirt & Included Stickers. You can get much cooler swags, it could even be a Socks, Hoodies, Pens, Notepad, Gym Bag, Keyboard, and even a Laptop!

Here's the <a href="https://hacktoberfestswaglist.com/">Hacktoberfest Swag List</a>, it contains all the swags for particular projects!
<h3>Are there any on-site events for Hacktoberfest?</h3>
Yes, there are many of them around the world. Check <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/events">Hacktoberfest Events List</a>, and try to attend a local event in your area, the organizers will help you to choose a project, submit pull requests, and more!
<h3>Can I host a Hacktoberfest event?</h3>
Yes, you can. Here's the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/eventkit">Hacktoberfest Event Organizer Kit</a>!
<blockquote>There are no events in my whole country. Hopefully, the next year I will start a Hacktoberfest Event with my friends, invite other developers who didn't know about it. Wait, you can do the same thing if you are reading this article, and you can't find a local Hacktoberfest Event in your city/country!</blockquote>
Those are some FAQs, but I know you might have more questions, and I couldn't write them better than the Official Website, they have a very detailed, section-based FAQ Page, where you will get an answer for all your questions!

<h2>Final Words</h2>
You don't need to be a Ninja Developer to submit 4 PRs and complete the Hacktoberfest Challenge. Don't overthink it, just share the challenge with your friends, and start hacking together. You could even improve each others' projects, and that's fine as long as you don't break the Rules!
