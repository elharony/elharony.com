<h2>Use it wisely...</h2>
Some students get so excited about those great benefits, and activate all benefits at once, which might lead to losing them all, especially the limited - one time - benefits.

What I recommend is activating the benefits that you need NOW, for example; You are into Front End Development, go and Activate the 6-month subscription with <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">Frontend Masters</a>.
<h2>I don't know what to do with these tools!</h2>
That's fine, most of us don't know what to do until we start checking others' projects ideas. GitHub made it easier by providing us with the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack/gallery">Student Gallery</a>, a place where students from across the world have made projects and resources with tools from the Pack. Also, there are great stories like <a href="https://github.blog/2018-08-01-how-the-github-student-developer-pack-helped-this-student-get-a-tech-job/">How the GitHub Student Developer Pack helped this student get a tech job</a>.
