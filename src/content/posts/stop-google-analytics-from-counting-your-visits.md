All of us noticed the inaccurate Google Analytics Traffic Reports, especially when hiring a freelancer to work on a new feature or so. That's because Google Analytics keep counting our traffic as Pageviews/Sessions to our site. In this article, I am going to show you how to fix this and stop Google Analytics from counting your visits - or a freelancer's visits.
<h2><strong>Block an IP Address Traffic in Google Analytics</strong></h2>
Let's see how we can block traffic coming from a specific IP Address:
<ul>
 	<li>Open your <strong><a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a></strong> account</li>
</ul>

 	<li>Choose "That are equal to"<strong>,</strong> to exclude exactly the following IP Address</li>
 	<li>IP Address: Write your IP Address here - <em>If you don’t know your IP, get it  from <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/">Whatismyipaddress</a> - If you are hiring a freelancer, ask for his/her IP Address to filter it!</em></li>
