In order to disable Google Hangouts on Gmail, you need two things:
<ol>
 	<li>Sign out from Google Hangouts on Gmail</li>
 	<li>Turn off Google Hangouts Chat on Gmail</li>
</ol>
Let's do both:
<h2>1) Sign out from Google Hangouts</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Under Gmail Inboxes, click on your Profile Picture</li>
 	<li>Scroll down, and click on "Sign out of Hangouts"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>We're done. Instead of looking at your Google Hangouts Chat, you will see "Sign In" option!</li>
</ul>

<h2>2) Turn off Google Hangouts Chat on Gmail</h2>
Now, we need to hide the Google Hangouts Chat area from our Gmail:
<ul>
 	<li>Click on the Settings Gear on the right side corner, and click on "Settings" from the menu</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Go to "Chat", and select the "Chat off" option, and hit "Save Changes"</li>
</ul>

The browser will reload, and you won't see "Google Hangouts" anymore on your Gmail, Hooray!Â ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥‚
